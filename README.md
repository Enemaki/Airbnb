## Airbnb Prototype: Mastering React Props

This React app showcases the power and importance of props in creating dynamic and reusable components â€“ all while exploring the functionality of an Airbnb-like experience.

### Learning React Props

Props are a fundamental concept in React, allowing data to flow from parent components to child components. This project serves as a playground to explore how props can be used to:

  * Customize component behavior.
  * Render conditional content.
  * Pass complex data structures.

### Project Overview

This is a simplified Airbnb-style listing app. It features:

  (1) Listings with details like title, description, price, and images (placeholders).
  (2) Filters to adjust search criteria (e.g., location, price range).
  (3) Listings displayed dynamically based on user interaction with filters.

Note: This is a basic learning project and may not implement the full functionality of a real Airbnb platform.

### Technologies Used

  * Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript
  * Framework: Vite React ([vitejs.dev](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://vitejs.dev/))

### Setup

1.  Clone the repository:

<!-- end list -->

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-props.git
```

2.  Install dependencies:

<!-- end list -->

```
npm install
```

3.  Run the app:

<!-- end list -->

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser at http://localhost:5173/.

### Exploring Props

Take a look at the project code to see how props are used in various components:

  * Listing component: Receives props to define title, description, price, image sources, etc.
  * Filter component: Receives props to define available filter options and updates them based on user interaction.
  * Main app: Renders child components and passes necessary props based on user selections.

### Contributing

While this project is primarily for learning purposes, feel free to fork the repository and experiment with different props usage scenarios\!
